## Description: Most instructions require you to write code. When I ask a 
##              direct, question please write a brief response in a comment.
##
##              Comment your code according to the guidelines discussed in 
##              class.

## At the top of your script, load the necessary libraries for the "Salaries"
## dataset and using the "ggplot" function.

## I. Intro Programming 
########################

## 1. Basic data types ---------------------------------------------------------

## Divide five by three.

## Have the console print out a greeting.

## Test the truth or falsity of three logical statements.


## 2.Variables  ---------------------------------------------------------

## Create a variable with the value of your favorite number. Create another 
## variable equal to the first variable, squared. Have the console print out 
## whether or not the second variable is equal to ten. 

## 3. 1-Dimensional Arrays  ----------------------------------------------------

## Create a numeric vector five elements long. 
## Lengthen it by three elements. Keep only the six elements in the middle. 

## 4. Logic and Loops  ---------------------------------------------------------

## For each element of the vector created in question 3, create a loop that tests
## if that element is greater than 7.2. If it is, have the console print out your
## favorite movie quote. If it isn't, print the title of your favorite book.

## Expand the code above such that, if a number is less than 7.2 but greater than 2, 
## the console prints out the title and artist of the last song you listened to.
## (Copy and paste your code so I can see both versions.)


########################
## II. 2D Arrays
########################

## Make a data.table of ten books you've read, with columns for title, author, 
## rating on a 1-5 scale, and whether the book is fiction or nonfiction. 

## Isolate just the "title" column

## Isolate just rows 4-7

## Summarize the data.table (using summary()). Does this dataset consist mostly of 
## fiction or nonfiction books? What is the average rating ? 

## Load the "Salaries" dataset. How many women are there in this dataset?
## How many men? What is the mean salary? What is the maximum salary among
## associate professors? What is the minimum time since Ph.D among the
## faculty in discipline A?

########################
## III. Visualization
########################

## Make a scatter plot of Salaries with years of service on the x axis
## and salary on the y axis

## Make a bar plot of salary. 

## Make a line plot of male faculty only, with years of service on the 
## x axis and salary on the y axis. What might be a better format for this
## plot?
